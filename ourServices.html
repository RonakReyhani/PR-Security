        <h3>Security Guards</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
        As business owners ourselves, we know how precious yours is. Our experienced guards with a professional outlook are available 
        for any situation, including sporting events, corporate functions and any other event where security may be required. Your business brand and the continuity of operations can be dramatically affected by the lack of an effective security strategy onsite,
        or at your events.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Evidence shows that a visible security presence deters opportunistic crime. A static guard is a highly visible asset that brings peace of mind to shoppers,
            attendees at events, the public in general, and to employees and their agents. PR Safari provides specialized site security guard services for a wide range of locations and situations in the Perth metropolitan area and 
            customized sites anywhere in Perth.
